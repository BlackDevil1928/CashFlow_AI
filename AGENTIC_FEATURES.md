## 🎯 Key Agentic Features

### **AI Financial Coach**
```
Location: src/lib/ai/agent-service.ts
```
**What it does:**
- Analyzes your complete financial context
- Generates prioritized recommendations
- Provides actionable insights
- Explains "why" behind suggestions

**Example Recommendations:**
- "Your food spending is 35% of income. Reducing by 15% could save ₹4,500/month."
- "Your Emergency Fund goal is behind schedule. Increase monthly savings by ₹3,000."
- "Unusual expense detected: ₹12,000 on Shopping is 3x your average."

### **ML Prediction Engine**
```
Location: src/lib/ai/ml-engine.ts
```
**What it does:**
- Predicts next month's spending per category
- Forecasts income for gig workers
- Calculates cashflow health score (0-100)
- Detects spending anomalies using statistical analysis

**Models:**
- **Spending Predictor**: Neural network with 3 hidden layers
- **Anomaly Detector**: Autoencoder for pattern recognition
- **Cashflow Scorer**: Rule-based + ML hybrid

### **Auto-Categorization**
```typescript
const { category, confidence } = await mlEngine.categorizeExpense(
  "Swiggy order #123",
  450
);
// Returns: { category: "food", confidence: 0.85 }
```

**Supported Categories:**
- Food, Transport, Entertainment, Bills, Shopping
- Health, Education, Groceries, Utilities, Personal Care
- Gifts, Travel, Investment, EMI, Insurance

### **Cashflow Health Score**
```typescript
const score = await agentService.calculateHealthScore();
// Returns 0-100 score based on:
// - Income stability (25 points)
// - Expense efficiency (25 points)  
// - Savings rate (20 points)
// - Debt management (15 points)
// - Liquidity (15 points)
```

### **Dynamic Goal Adjuster**
The AI notices when goals are off-track and suggests:
- Adjusted target amounts

## 🚀 Quick Start for Developers

### 1. **Initialize AI Engine**
```typescript
// In your main App.tsx
import { mlEngine } from '@/lib/ai/ml-engine';
import { agentService } from '@/lib/ai/agent-service';

useEffect(() => {
  // Initialize ML models
  mlEngine.initialize();
}, []);
```

### 2. **Use Auto-Categorization**
```typescript
import { mlEngine } from '@/lib/ai/ml-engine';

const handleExpenseSubmit = async (data) => {
  // Auto-categorize
  const { category, confidence } = await mlEngine.categorizeExpense(
    data.description,
    data.amount
  );
  
  // Use suggested category or user's choice
  const finalCategory = data.category || category;
  
  // Save to database
  await supabase.from('expenses').insert({
    ...data,
    category: finalCategory,
    confidence_score: confidence
  });
};
```

### 3. **Get Agent Recommendations**
```typescript
import { agentService } from '@/lib/ai/agent-service';

const DashboardPage = () => {
  const [recommendations, setRecommendations] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const loadRecommendations = async () => {
      await agentService.initialize(userId);
      const recs = await agentService.generateRecommendations();
      setRecommendations(recs);
    };
    loadRecommendations();
  }, [userId]);
  
  return (
    <div>
      {recommendations.map(rec => (
        <RecommendationCard key={rec.title} recommendation={rec} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 4. **Calculate Health Score**
```typescript
const score = await agentService.calculateHealthScore();
// Score is automatically saved to database
```

### 5. **Train Models (Background Task)**
```typescript
// Run periodically or when user has enough data
async function trainModels(userId: string) {
  try {
    const trainingData = await mlEngine.getTrainingData(userId);
    await mlEngine.trainSpendingPrediction(trainingData);
    toast.success('AI model updated with your data!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Not enough data yet, need 30+ transactions');
  }
}
```

expect(result.category).toBe("transport");
expect(result.confidence).toBeGreaterThan(0.7);
```

### Test Anomaly Detection:
```typescript
const anomaly = await mlEngine.detectAnomaly({
  amount: 15000,  // Much higher than usual
  category: "food",
  dayOfWeek: 3,
  hourOfDay: 14
});
expect(anomaly.isAnomaly).toBe(true);
```

### Test Health Score:
```typescript
const score = mlEngine.calculateCashflowScore({
  monthlyIncome: 50000,
  monthlyExpenses: 30000,
  savings: 10000,
  debts: 5000,
  liquidity: 30000

- **Predictive Budgeting**: AI creates next month's budget
- **Auto-Bill Payment**: Agent pays bills automatically (with confirmation)

---

## 🎓 How It Learns

### 1. **Implicit Feedback**
- Tracks which recommendations user acts on
- Monitors budget adjustments after suggestions
- Observes goal modifications

### 2. **Explicit Feedback**
- 👍/👎 on recommendations
- "Was this prediction accurate?" prompts
- User corrections to auto-categorization

### 3. **Behavioral Signals**
- Time spent on different features
- Transaction patterns over time
- Goal achievement rates

### 4. **Continuous Improvement**
```typescript
// Log prediction for learning
await mlEngine.logPrediction(
  userId,
  'spending_forecast',
  predictedAmount,
  actualAmount  // When month ends
);

// System analyzes accuracy and retrains
if (accuracy < threshold) {
  await retrainModel(userId);
}
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your agentic AI is working well when:
- ✅ 80%+ of users engage with recommendations
- ✅ Health scores improve over 3+ months
- ✅ Users save 15%+ more than before
- ✅ 50%+ of expenses are auto-categorized correctly
- ✅ Budget adherence improves by 25%+
- ✅ Users return daily (high DAU)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Basic categorization → Predictions → Full agent
2. **Show Confidence**: Always display ML confidence scores
3. **Explain AI**: Tell users WHY the AI suggests something
4. **Allow Override**: Users should always have final say
5. **Celebrate Wins**: Highlight when AI helped save money
6. **Be Transparent**: Show what data is used for learning

---

## 🛠️ Debugging AI Issues

### Model not training?
```typescript
// Check if user has enough data
const { data: expenses } = await supabase
  .from('expenses')
  .select('count')
  .eq('user_id', userId);

if (expenses.count < 30) {
  console.log('Need more data. Current: ', expenses.count);
}
```

### Poor categorization accuracy?
- Add more keywords to keyword dict
- Collect user corrections
- Retrain with corrected data

### Recommendations not relevant?
- Check if agent context is loading correctly
- Verify user preferences are set
- Review recommendation priority logic
