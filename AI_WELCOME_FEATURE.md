# AI Welcome Message Feature

## 🎉 Overview
When users enter the dashboard, they are now greeted by an AI-powered welcome message that:
- **Personalizes** the greeting with their first name
- **Adapts** based on time of day (morning/afternoon/evening)
- **Shows** as an elegant toast notification
- **Updates** the dashboard header to include their name

## ✨ Features

### 1. Personalized Header
The dashboard header now displays:
```
Welcome back, [FirstName]! 👋
```
Instead of the generic:
```
Welcome to CashFlow AI
```

### 2. AI Toast Notification
A beautiful toast notification appears 500ms after entering the dashboard with:
- **Dynamic greeting** based on time:
  - Morning (before 12 PM): "Good morning"
  - Afternoon (12 PM - 5 PM): "Good afternoon"  
  - Evening (after 5 PM): "Good evening"

- **Random personalized messages:**
  - "Good morning, [Name]! 🌟 Ready to take control of your finances today?"
  - "Welcome back, [Name]! 💰 Let's make smart money moves together."
  - "Good afternoon! 👋 I'm here to help you achieve your financial goals, [Name]."
  - "Hey [Name]! 🚀 Your financial journey continues. Let's see what we can accomplish today!"

- **Subtitle:** "Track expenses, monitor budgets, and earn rewards as you manage your money."
- **Duration:** 5 seconds

### 3. Smart Name Detection
The system gets the user's name from:
1. **First priority:** `user_metadata.full_name` (from sign up)
2. **Second priority:** Email username (before @)
3. **Fallback:** "there" if nothing else is available

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### File Modified
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

### Key Changes
1. **Added state variables:**
   - `userName` - Stores the user's first name
   - `hasShownWelcome` - Prevents showing welcome message multiple times

2. **New useEffect hook:**
   - Fetches user data from Supabase
   - Extracts first name
   - Determines time-based greeting
   - Shows random welcome message
   - Only runs once per dashboard visit

3. **Updated header:**
   - Conditionally displays personalized message when name is available

### Code Flow
```
1. User enters dashboard
   ↓
2. useEffect fires → Fetch user from Supabase
   ↓
3. Extract name from metadata or email
   ↓
4. Determine time-based greeting
   ↓
5. Select random welcome message
   ↓
6. Wait 500ms → Show toast notification
   ↓
7. Update header with user name
   ↓
8. Set hasShownWelcome to prevent duplicates
```

## 🚀 Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Sign up with full name:**
   ```
   Sign up → Enter "John Doe" as name → Login
   Expected: "Welcome back, John! 👋"
   ```

2. **Sign up without full name:**
   ```
   Sign up → Email: sarah@example.com → Login
   Expected: "Welcome back, sarah! 👋"
   ```

3. **Different times:**
   ```
   - Visit at 9 AM → "Good morning"
   - Visit at 3 PM → "Good afternoon"  
   - Visit at 8 PM → "Good evening"
   ```

4. **Multiple visits:**
   ```
   First visit → Toast appears
   Refresh → Toast appears again (expected)
   Navigate away & back → Toast appears (expected)
   ```
