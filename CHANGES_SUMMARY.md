# Changes Summary

## üîß Authentication Fix

### Problem
- After signing in/up, users were redirected to landing page "/" 
- Landing page had a useEffect that checked for session and redirected to dashboard
- This caused a 5-second delay before redirecting to dashboard

### Solution
**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Auth.tsx`
  - Changed login redirect from `navigate("/")` to `navigate("/dashboard")` (line 32)
  - Changed Google OAuth redirect from `${origin}/` to `${origin}/dashboard` (line 71)

**Result:** Users now go directly to dashboard after authentication with no delay.

## üí∞ Points Redemption System with Real User Data

### New Files Created

#### 1. `src/hooks/useUserPoints.ts`
A custom React hook that manages user gamification data from the database:
- **Fetches** user points from `user_gamification` table
- **Creates** gamification record if user doesn't have one
- **Manages** redemption history (stored in localStorage)
- **Functions:**
  - `redeemVoucher(voucherId, pointsCost)` - Deducts points and records redemption
  - `addPoints(points, reason)` - Adds points with notification
  - `refreshPoints()` - Reloads data from database

#### 2. `src/pages/Redemption.tsx` (Updated)
Fully functional rewards center page integrated with database:
- **Real User Data:**
  - Points fetched from `user_gamification` table
  - Shows actual available, total, and spent points
  - Tracks redemption history per user
  
- **Features:**
  - 9 vouchers across 5 categories (E-commerce, Food & Beverage, Entertainment, Transportation, Fashion, Electronics)
  - Real-time point validation
  - Loading states with spinner
  - Confirmation dialog before redemption
  - Redemption history tracking
  - Demo button to add test points (can be removed in production)

- **Vouchers Include:**
  - Amazon ($25 - 2500 points)
  - Starbucks ($15 - 1500 points)
  - Netflix ($20 - 2000 points)
  - Spotify ($10 - 1000 points)

  - Apple Store ($100 - 10000 points)
  - Zomato ($20 - 2000 points)
  - BookMyShow ($15 - 1500 points)

### Integration with Existing System
- Uses existing `user_gamification` table from database
- Points are earned automatically when:
  - Adding expenses (+10 points per expense via database trigger)
  - Maintaining daily streaks
  - Completing goals
  - Other gamification activities

### Database Schema Used
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.user_gamification (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  level INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  total_points INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  current_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  longest_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_activity_date DATE,
  badges TEXT[],
  achievements JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  challenges_completed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
